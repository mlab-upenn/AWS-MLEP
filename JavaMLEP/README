STEPS: 

1. Setup the BCVTB_HOME variable. You can do this in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file. 
Make sure the path you specify takes you to the /bcvtb folder in the MLE+ configuration. 
The EC2 instance already has this setup properly.  

# BCVTB PATH for MLE+                                                                                                                                                 
export BCVTB_HOME=/Users/willyg/Documents/Git/mlep_v2.0/MLE+/bcvtb/ 

Make sure you source your .bashrc or .bash_profile after you change this. 

2. You can run the example I included by typing the follwing. 

java -jar mlepJava1.jar SmallOffice-000001 1.txt

NOTES:
1. "1.txt" has the information with the inputs 
2. SmallOffice-000001.idf is a Small Office building with only one input (Cooling SP). 
3. This should run properly, but it might take some time as it is running every 1min.
